Todayâ€™s Problem: Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.

Following is definition of LCA from Wikipedia:
Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both 
n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
